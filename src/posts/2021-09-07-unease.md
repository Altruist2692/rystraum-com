There is a lot of work to be done. A lot of things depend on me. There are a lot of other things that I would like to do. But I just feel so uneasy lately. I'm slow to move and I have trouble concentrating.

Maybe I'm bored with what I'm doing.
Maybe I've lost sight of why I'm doing these things.
Maybe I'm slowly dying while I'm still alive.

It scares me but at the same time, I can't seem to care.
